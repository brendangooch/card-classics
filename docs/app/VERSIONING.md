# Versioning & Release Strategy

## v1.0.0 (MVP)
- The first playable, testable version.
- Focus: core gameplay, server-driven logic, basic UI, and single-player mode.

## v2.0.0+
- Major new features, modes, and improvements.
- Each new feature or enhancement is developed in a branch off the mainline.

## Workflow
1. Define MVP in `FEATURES.md`.
2. Build and test MVP (v1.0.0).
3. For each new feature, create a branch from main, implement, and merge when ready.
4. Update `FEATURES.md` and bump version as features are released.
