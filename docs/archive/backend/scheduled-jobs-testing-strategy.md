# Scheduled Jobs (Cron) Testing Strategy

This document outlines the recommended strategy for testing scheduled jobs (cron jobs) in the Card Classics backend.

## Strategy Overview
- Write job logic as standalone functions to enable unit testing.
- Use scheduling libraries (e.g., node-cron, agenda) to trigger jobs in development and production.
- For manual testing, invoke job functions directly in test scripts or via CLI.
- For integration testing, set short intervals (e.g., every minute) and verify logs, database changes, or output files.
- Mock time or scheduling triggers in automated tests to simulate job execution.
- Document expected outcomes and edge cases for each scheduled job.

## Notes
- No code setup is included in this document; it is focused on strategy and best practices.
- Update this guide as new scheduled jobs are added or requirements change.
