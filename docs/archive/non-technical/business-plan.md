# Card Classics: Simple Business Plan


Card Classics is an online platform designed to bring the timeless enjoyment of classic card games to a modern, global audience. The focus is on substance over style—delivering engaging gameplay, intuitive controls, and a welcoming environment for all players, especially those who value playability and ease of use over flashy graphics.

The target market includes adults of all ages, with a special emphasis on males over 40 and the elderly, who often appreciate classic games and straightforward experiences. Families, friends, and anyone seeking a fun, social way to connect online are welcome. The platform is also designed to be accessible to players with limited cognitive or mental capabilities, offering adaptive AI, extremely simple menus, layouts, and games to ensure everyone can participate and enjoy.

Key features include a clean and responsive interface, real-time singleplayer or multiplayer gameplay, customizable game rules, player profiles, leaderboards, and optional tutorials for new players. Fairness, security, and privacy are top priorities.

The first release will focus on a small, high-quality selection of classic games, including:
- 3-Card Brag
- Snap
- Clock Patience
- Crib (and variants)
- A popular game known as "Shithead" (to be released under a more family-friendly name)

The current target is to deliver a working MVP (minimal viable product) accessible online, allowing players to enjoy these games from any modern web browser.

The initial goal is to build a sustainable user base and generate enough revenue to support ongoing development and community growth. Players can compete in online tournaments against other human players (or AI) to win big (virtual) prizes. Participation in tournament games requires a token, which can be purchased in small bundles (each token is roughly equal to 10p). The core gameplay remains free and accessible to all.

My background includes running businesses in various industries, developing a working enterprise web application, and five years of hobbyist game design. I am now pursuing game development semi-professionally, driven by a social conscience, a passion for creating beautiful player experiences, and a desire to take on challenging projects. My business philosophy is to build slowly and organically, focusing on exceptional attention to detail and playability/usability, rather than maximizing revenue at all costs. I believe that by delivering a great user experience, success will follow naturally. To mitigate risk, I will develop other projects alongside Card Classics.

Players on Card Classics are agnostic and loosely labelled—judged only on their score and skills, not on personal details or social status. The platform is designed to be welcoming, fair, and focused on the enjoyment of the games themselves.


**Targets & Milestones**

- Year 1: Aim for 1,000 active users and 100 tournament games played per month.
- Year 2: Grow to 5,000 active users and 500 tournament games per month.
- Revenue goal: Achieve £500/month in token sales by the end of Year 2, enough to cover hosting and ongoing development.
- Focus on steady, organic growth and player satisfaction over aggressive expansion.

**Realistic Income Evaluation**

Targeting an income of £1,000–£2,000 per month within 18 months from Card Classics and similar small, self-managed apps is ambitious but achievable with the right approach. Success will depend on:
- Finding strong product-market fit and building a loyal user base for at least one app.
- Rapidly shipping MVPs, validating demand, and iterating based on user feedback.
- Diversifying across several apps to increase chances of success, while keeping costs low and reinvesting early profits.
- Ethical monetization (subscriptions, premium features, digital goods) and building user trust over time.

Most indie developers experience slow initial growth, with income ramping up as more products are released and the audience grows. Consistent marketing, community building, and ongoing updates are key. This plan is realistic for a dedicated, experienced solo developer with a long-term focus and a willingness to learn from each release.

Card Classics aims to become the go-to destination for anyone seeking a fun, fair, and relaxing card game experience online, built on a foundation of integrity, accessibility, and genuine care for our players.
