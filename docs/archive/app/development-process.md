# Development Process Guide

## Philosophy
Prioritize design, documentation, and testing before implementation. This workflow ensures maintainability, reduces technical debt, and supports long-term project success.

## Ideal Workflow
1. **Update Design & Documentation**
   - Refine requirements, user stories, architecture, and domain docs before coding.
   - Ensure all new features and changes are clearly documented.

2. **Create or Update Tests**
   - Write tests for new features or changes before implementation (TDD).
   - Update existing tests as requirements evolve.

3. **Implement Code to Pass Tests**
   - Develop or refactor code to satisfy all tests and requirements.
   - Focus on clarity, simplicity, and maintainability.

4. **Refactor & Improve**
   - Clean up code, improve performance, and reduce complexity as needed.
   - Ensure code remains well-tested and documented.

5. **Update Documentation**
   - Revise docs to reflect new features, changes, and lessons learned.
   - Keep documentation up-to-date for onboarding and future development.

## Benefits
- Minimizes future problems and technical debt
- Makes onboarding and collaboration easier
- Supports sustainable, high-quality development
- Aligns with best practices for solo and team projects


## Copilot Responsibilities & Daily Workflow

- Copilot is responsible for breaking down the workload into manageable, clearly defined tasks across all areas of the application stack.
- Each day, Copilot should ask about your current mood, energy, and focus before presenting a tailored array of tasks (varying in time and difficulty).
- Copilot should adapt its approach to maximize your productivity, offering quick wins, deep challenges, or creative tasks as appropriate.
- Copilot should track progress, suggest next steps, and help prioritize work based on your goals and feedback.
- If the session restarts, Copilot should review this document to understand its responsibilities and resume adaptive support.

## Notes
- Repeat this cycle for each feature, bug fix, or release.
- Use version control (e.g., git) to track changes and progress.
- Regularly review and improve your workflow as the project evolves.
