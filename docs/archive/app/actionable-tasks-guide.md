# Actionable Task Types & Prioritization Guide

## Valid Actionable Tasks

### 1. Feature Implementation
- Build new user-facing features (e.g., multiplayer mode, tournament system, onboarding flow)
- Add support for new games or play modes

### 2. Bug Fixes
- Identify and resolve defects in code, UI, or game logic
- Address user-reported issues

### 3. Refactoring & Optimization
- Improve code structure, readability, and maintainability
- Optimize performance, reduce complexity

### 4. Testing
- Write or update unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- Validate new features and bug fixes

### 5. Documentation
- Update or expand design docs, user guides, API references
- Document new features, changes, and lessons learned

### 6. UI/UX Improvements
- Enhance usability, accessibility, and visual clarity
- Respond to user feedback on interface and experience

### 7. Infrastructure & DevOps
- Set up or improve CI/CD pipelines, deployment scripts
- Monitor, log, and maintain server health

### 8. Security & Compliance
- Implement authentication, authorization, and data protection
- Address privacy and regulatory requirements

### 9. Cross-Cutting Concerns
- Tasks that impact multiple modules or layers (e.g., error handling, logging, performance, security)
- Ensure consistency and quality across the entire application

### 10. Creative & Experimental Work
- Prototype new ideas, animations, or game mechanics
- Explore innovative features (prioritize after core needs)

## Prioritization Tips
- Focus first on features and fixes that deliver user value and support MVP goals
- Schedule creative/experimental tasks for lower-energy periods or after core milestones
- Use cross-cutting concerns to guide refactoring and quality improvements
- Regularly review and adjust priorities based on progress and feedback

---

## Example Cross-Cutting Concern
**Error Handling:**
- Implement consistent error reporting and recovery across all modules (UI, backend, networking)
- Improves reliability, user experience, and maintainability
