# Player Agnosticism & Username System

Date: July 29, 2025

## Overview
This document describes the philosophy and design for player agnosticism on Card Classics, focusing on neutral, playful display names and discreet identity features.

## Philosophy
- Every player remains neutral and agnostic on the platform, minimizing bias and personal exposure.
- Player identity is centered around fun, light-hearted, and playful display names, not personal information.

## Username Generation & Private Game Naming
- Each player is assigned a randomly generated display name upon joining (e.g., "SwiftFox", "LuckyAceRunner").
- Names are created by combining two or three words from a large, curated collection of related, positive, and playful words.
- Players can customize or select from suggested word combinations during onboarding.
- In private games (e.g., challenge-friend mode), players may enter their own display name. Opponents have the option to expel a player who uses vulgar or inappropriate language in their name.
- For added fun and anonymity, private games may optionally hide player names during play, so friends won't know for sure which player is which until after the game. This can spark friendly debate outside the game about who played best, though it may be confusing for some users.
- A feature-rich username selection tool may be developed to make this process engaging and memorable.

## Avatars & Identity
- Avatars are optional, discreet, and designed to minimize status signaling.
- Player graphics focus on rewards, stars, trophies, and achievements rather than personal appearance.
- The platform encourages fair play, community spirit, and a welcoming environment for all.
- In-game communication is limited to a curated emoji interface, allowing players to express themselves in a light-hearted, non-verbal way. This helps maintain a positive atmosphere and reduces the risk of negative interactions.

## Notes
- The username system supports privacy, inclusivity, and a fun onboarding experience.
- Emoji-based communication keeps interactions playful and safe.
- Expulsion for vulgar names in private games empowers players to maintain a respectful environment.
- Optional anonymous play in challenge-friend mode can add a layer of intrigue and friendly debate, but may be confusing for some users.
- Future enhancements may include seasonal or event-based word collections for added variety.
- Seasonal emojis and greetings (e.g., Easter, Christmas) can be added to the emoji interface to celebrate holidays and special events, making the experience more festive and engaging.
