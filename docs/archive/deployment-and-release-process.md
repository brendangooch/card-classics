# Deployment & Release Process

Date: July 28, 2025

## Overview
This document describes the deployment and release process for Card Classics, ensuring reliable, secure, and maintainable delivery of updates to users.

## Goals
- Automate build, test, and deployment steps
- Minimize downtime and risk during releases
- Support rollback and recovery
- Maintain version control and release history

## Deployment Pipeline
- Use CI/CD tools (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins) to automate:
  - Code checkout and build
  - Run all tests (unit, integration, E2E)
  - Linting and static analysis
  - Package and artifact creation
  - Deploy to staging environment
  - Manual or automated approval for production release
  - Deploy to production environment

## Release Management
- Tag releases in version control (e.g., git tags)
- Maintain changelogs for each release
- Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Announce releases to users (in-app, email, etc.)

## Rollback & Recovery
- Keep previous release artifacts for quick rollback
- Automate rollback steps in CI/CD pipeline
- Monitor deployments for errors and performance issues

## Environment Configuration
- Store secrets and environment variables securely (e.g., .env files, cloud secret managers)
- Use separate configs for development, staging, and production
- Document environment setup for new developers

## Best Practices
- Test deployments in staging before production
- Monitor health and error rates after each release
- Document deployment and release steps for maintainability

## Future Considerations
- Blue/green or canary deployments for zero-downtime releases
- Automated performance and security checks
- User opt-in for beta features
