# Security & Authentication Design

Date: July 28, 2025

## Overview
This document outlines the security and authentication strategy for Card Classics, covering user identity, session management, data protection, and secure communication.

## Goals
- Protect user data and game state
- Prevent unauthorized access and cheating
- Support both guest and registered users
- Enable secure client-server communication

## Authentication Types
- **Guest Authentication:**
  - Users can join games as guests with a temporary session ID
  - Minimal data stored; limited features
- **Registered User Authentication:**
  - Users register with email/password or OAuth provider
  - Persistent user profile and game history

## Session Management
- Use secure, signed tokens (JWT or session cookies) for authentication
- Assign a UUID to each device/session and send it with every request.
- Map UUIDs to sessions server-side. If a user logs in from a new device, detect the change and invalidate or migrate the previous session.
- Prevent users from logging in with multiple devices and joining the same game multiple timesâ€”only one device/session per user is allowed at a time.
- Expire sessions after inactivity or logout
- Store minimal sensitive data on the client

## Data Protection
- Hash and salt passwords using industry standards (bcrypt, Argon2)
- Never store plaintext passwords
- Use HTTPS for all client-server communication
- Validate and sanitize all user input

## Game Integrity
- Validate all game actions server-side
- Prevent client-side manipulation of game state
- Log suspicious activity and enforce rate limits

## Secure Communication
- Enforce HTTPS/TLS for all endpoints
- Use WebSocket Secure (wss://) for real-time communication
- Protect against replay attacks and man-in-the-middle attacks

## Future Considerations
- Two-factor authentication for registered users
- Account recovery and password reset flows
- Audit logging and monitoring
