# Player Journey & Token Rewards

Date: July 29, 2025

## Player Journey
- Design progression to encourage engagement and skill development.
- Registered members get early access to new games in single player mode.
- Registered users see a more comprehensive game index page.


## Token Rewards
- Do not give free tokens to new users immediately.
- Use tokens as rewards for passing achievements or reaching milestones (e.g., played 10 single player games, challenged a friend).
- This creates a barrier to entry for online tournaments, helping ensure skilled opponents.
- Token rewards incentivize engagement and progression, making achievements meaningful.

## Notes
- Token and achievement systems should be designed to balance accessibility and competition.
- Community feedback can help refine progression and reward strategies.
