## Player Journey & Token Rewards
- Do not give free tokens to new users immediately.
- Use tokens as rewards for passing achievements or reaching milestones (e.g., played 10 single player games, challenged a friend).
- This creates a barrier to entry for online tournaments, helping ensure skilled opponents.
- Token rewards incentivize engagement and progression, making achievements meaningful.
# Card Classics MVP: Release & Engagement Strategy

Date: July 29, 2025

## Game Release Strategy
- Develop new games rapidly (1-2 weeks per game), but release thoughtfully to avoid overwhelming users.
- Use special events (public holidays like Easter, Christmas, Diwali, etc.) for themed releases and increased engagement.
- Group similar game variants under clear categories or collections to reduce confusion.
- Use analytics and user feedback to guide release timing and selection.
- Soft launch or limited release new games to registered users for early testing.
- Each developed game adds to platform value, even if not released immediately.

## User Engagement & Community
- Encourage users to suggest new games via social media (e.g., "Help Us Build the Ultimate Card Game Library! Suggest Your Favorite Games Below").
- Registered members get early access to new games in single player mode.
- Registered users see a more comprehensive game index page.
- Collate data on many card games to spot patterns and abstract similarities for future development.
- Consider co-managing digital marketing with experienced partners.

## Interface Design Changes
- New flow: Select game → Play → Select mode → (Configure) → Play.
- Improves user experience and supports early access strategy.

## Notes
- Release strategy is a tool for engagement and platform growth.
- Community involvement and data collection drive future innovation.
