# Project Overview

## Working Philosophy & Principles

- Focus on projects that are both challenging and rewarding, prioritizing creativity and enjoyment over material gain.
- The principal aim is to create an online game that brings fun and happiness to as many people as possible.
- Value the creative process and strive to make a positive impact, rather than being driven by data, profit, or the endless pursuit of capital.
- Work in bursts or sprints: alternate between periods of high focus on specific tasks and times of broader, abstract discussion and planning.
- Flexibility in workflow: sometimes working on concrete implementation, other times on design, vision, and long-term planning to keep the project moving forward.

## Vision
Card Classics is an online gaming platform dedicated to reviving and celebrating classic and lesser-known card games. Our goal is to offer a rich library of games that have faded from mainstream popularity, providing players with a nostalgic and engaging experience.


## Core Modes
- **Single-player Mode:** Play against computer opponents or solo challenges. *(Free to use)*
- **Challenge Friend Mode:** Generate a link to challenge friends and play against each other online. *(Free to use)*
- **Tournament Mode:** Participate in tournaments to earn points, status, and rewards. *(Requires purchasable tokens to play)*

Each mode features sub-modes and a player journey centered around progression, points, and status.

## Initial Games
- **3-Card Brag** (formerly Bastard Brag): A unique twist on the classic Brag game.
- **Clock Patience:** A classic solitaire game, already implemented.
- **Snap:** A fast-paced reaction game, planned for early development.

## Roadmap
- Expand the game library to include dozens, then hundreds, of classic card games.
- Continuously improve player experience, progression, and community features.

## Target Audience
- Card game enthusiasts
- Players seeking nostalgia
- Anyone interested in learning or rediscovering forgotten card games
