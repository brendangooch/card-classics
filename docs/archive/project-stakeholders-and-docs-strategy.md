## Documentation Strategy
- **Technical Documents:**

  - Target audience: developers, technical contributors, system administrators
- **Non-Technical Documents:**
  - Philosophy, values, stakeholder proposals, cloud deployment overview, marketing, user guides, onboarding, accessibility
  - Target audience: stakeholders, partners, sponsors, authorities, general users
- **Mixed/Transitional Documents:**
  - MVP requirements, user stories, product strategy, release plans
  - Target audience: both technical and non-technical stakeholders

## Organization Principles
- Clearly separate technical and non-technical docs in the folder structure
- Use plain language and visuals for non-technical docs
- Keep technical docs up-to-date and detailed for contributors
- Maintain a central index or README to guide stakeholders to relevant documents

## Notes
- Documentation evolves as new stakeholders join and project needs change
- Regularly review and refactor docs to ensure clarity and accessibility for all audiences
