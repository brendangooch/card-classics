# Scalability Summary

This document outlines the scalability considerations and strategies for the Card Classics thin client architecture.

## Horizontal Scaling
- Add additional WebSocket server instances to handle increased traffic.
- Use a load balancer or gateway (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy, or a cloud load balancer) to distribute new connections across instances.

## Session Affinity (Sticky Sessions)
- Ensure each player's WebSocket connection stays with the same server instance for the duration of a game (sticky sessions).
- Route based on session or game ID if needed.

## State Management
- Each game instance keeps its state in memory for fast access.
- Persist session state to disk or a database (e.g., MongoDB) on every update, overwriting the same state file/document to minimize storage.
- A single MongoDB service can be used behind all WebSocket server instances for persistence and quick reloads if memory fails.

## Autoscaling
- In cloud environments, set up autoscaling rules to add or remove server instances based on CPU, memory, or connection count.

## Graceful Degradation
- If the system is overloaded, event and state broadcasts may be delayed, but the system remains operational.

This approach ensures the platform can handle both gradual growth and sudden traffic spikes, while maintaining reliability and performance.
