# Testing & Quality Assurance Strategy

## Guiding Principles
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) wherever practical
- Maintainability, reliability, and rapid feedback
- Separation of concerns and SOLID design principles

---

## 1. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- New modules/components are scaffolded with tests before implementation.
- Tests define expected behavior and serve as living documentation.
- Encourages modular, loosely-coupled code.

## 2. Testing Tools & Frameworks
- **Jest**: Primary framework for unit and integration tests (TypeScript support).
- **Manual Testing**: Developer playground for rapid, interactive testing of UI components and usability/feel.
- **Mock Server**: Simulates server/game events for integration and simulation tests.

## 3. Developer Playground
- Dedicated folder (e.g., `/playground`) for loading and testing components in isolation.
- Supports hot-reloading for rapid iteration.
- Used for manual usability and visual testing.

## 4. Test Coverage
- Core logic (domain, state management, networking) covered by automated Jest tests.
- UI/UX and animation flows tested manually in the playground.
- Aim for high coverage on critical logic; pragmatic approach for UI/animation.

## 5. SOLID Principles & Interfaces
- Heavy use of interfaces between modules/components to enable mocking and isolation in tests.
- Object-oriented code follows SOLID principles for maintainability and extensibility.

## 6. Linting & Formatting
- **ESLint**: Enforces code style and catches common errors.
- **Prettier**: Ensures consistent formatting across modules.
- Linting and formatting run as part of the development workflow.

## 7. Workflow Integration
- Tests and linting run before commits (optionally via pre-commit hooks).
- Code reviews focus on test coverage, SOLID adherence, and code clarity.
- Testing and QA are integrated into the git milestone/release workflow.
