# Theming & Customization Strategy

Date: July 28, 2025

## Overview
This document describes the theming and customization strategy for Card Classics, enabling flexible, user-driven visual experiences and future extensibility.

## Goals
- Support multiple visual themes (e.g., classic, modern, high-contrast)
- Allow users to customize UI elements and layouts
- Enable rapid addition of new themes and styles

## Theming Architecture
- Use a centralized theme configuration (JSON, CSS variables, or JS objects)
- Define theme properties: colors, fonts, spacing, component styles
- Apply themes dynamically at runtime (client-side)
- Separate theme logic from core game logic and UI rendering

## Customization Features
- Allow users to select and switch themes in settings
- Support custom backgrounds, card designs, and table layouts
- Persist user preferences (local storage or user profile)
- Provide accessibility-focused themes (high-contrast, large text)

## Extensibility
- Design theme system to support future games and UI components
- Enable server-driven theme payloads for multi-game support
- Document theme structure and versioning for maintainability

## Best Practices
- Test all themes for usability and accessibility
- Avoid hardcoding colors or styles in components
- Document theme requirements for all new features

## Future Considerations
- Community-created themes and marketplace
- Animated and seasonal themes
- Theme preview and sharing features
