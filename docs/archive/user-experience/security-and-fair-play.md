# Security & Fair Play

## Thin Client Architecture
- The client is restricted to sending only valid requests and may perform light validation.
- The server is the single point of truth for all game state and logic, minimizing opportunities for cheating.

## Integrity & Motivation
- Players compete for fun and status (e.g., earning stars), not for monetary gain, reducing the incentive to hack or cheat.
- Maintaining the integrity of tournament play is important to preserve the value of achievements and status symbols.


## Invitation Links & Private Games
- Invitation links contain a unique invitation ID, which is separate from the game ID for added security.
- Each invitation has an ID and an expiry date/time, ensuring links cannot be reused indefinitely.
- The invitation ID is designed to be secure enough to deter hackers from breaking into private games between friends.

## Additional Measures
- Ongoing monitoring and validation on the server side to detect and prevent suspicious activity.
- Simple reporting or moderation tools may be added if needed as the userbase grows.

This approach ensures a fair and enjoyable experience for all players, with a focus on integrity and fun over profit.
