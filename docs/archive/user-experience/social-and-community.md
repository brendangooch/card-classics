# Social & Community Features

## Communication
- No in-game chat or messaging system is planned.
- Players generate a game link and share it with friends using their own messaging apps.
- The only in-game communication is a simple emoji system, allowing players (human or AI) to signal feelings (e.g., happy, sad, angry, confused) to others during play. This can be used for fun or bluffing.

## Friends & Leaderboards
- No formal friends list or leaderboard system is planned at this stage.
- The system may keep track of victories against friends for personal achievement.

This approach keeps the experience simple, safe, and focused on gameplay, while still allowing for light social interaction and friendly competition.
