# Game Rules & Customization

## Default Configurations
- Each game and mode of play comes with a fixed default configuration for quick and easy setup ("like a McDonald's menu").
- Players can start games immediately using these defaults.

## Customization Options
- Players may choose to customize their game experience with options such as:
  - Number of players (human or AI)
  - Number of jokers or wild cards
  - Number of lives or rounds
  - Other game-specific rules
- Special single-player challenges and tournament lobbies will offer curated configurations and unique rule sets.

## Approach
- The UI will clearly distinguish between default and custom options.
- This compromise supports both quick play and deep customization, appealing to a wide range of players.

This approach ensures a streamlined, user-friendly experience while supporting flexibility for enthusiasts and tournament play.
