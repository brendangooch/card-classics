# Accessibility & Internationalization

## Accessibility
- The platform is designed to be inclusive, with a special focus on players with mental impairments or slower processing speeds.
- AI opponents will be responsive to the player's abilities, ensuring all players can progress and remain engaged regardless of natural ability.
- Plans include support for:
  - Adjustable game speed and turn timers
  - Clear, readable UI with adjustable text size
  - Colorblind-friendly palettes
  - Simple, intuitive controls
  - Screen reader compatibility (where feasible)


## Internationalization
- The platform aims to support multiple languages, with an initial focus on Europe and the major European languages.
- A flag icon menu will be present on each page, allowing users to switch languages with a single click.
- The use of emojis for in-game communication helps break down language barriers, ensuring all players can interact regardless of nationality.
- Every player in the tournament lobby is equal, with status determined only by in-game achievements.

Language support will be expanded based on user demand and community feedback.

This approach ensures that Card Classics is accessible and enjoyable for as many players as possible, regardless of ability or language.
