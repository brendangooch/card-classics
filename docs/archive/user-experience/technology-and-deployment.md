# Technology Stack & Deployment

## Technology Preferences
- The backend will use Node.js and socket-based communication for real-time multiplayer features.
- The application will be containerized using Docker Compose for local development and testing.
- Planned containers:
  - Static asset server
  - API/gateway server
  - Multiplayer socket server

## Deployment & Security
- The project may be kept private to protect proprietary work, with public deployment only for testing or demonstration purposes.
- GitHub Pages may be used for quick uploads and device testing during development.
- The architecture is designed to fail gracefully under load: if the server is overworked, game event/state broadcasts will simply take longer to respond.

This approach ensures a flexible, secure, and scalable development and deployment process, supporting both local and online testing.
