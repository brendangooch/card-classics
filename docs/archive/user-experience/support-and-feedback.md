# Support & Feedback

## Player Support
- An FAQ section will be available to address common questions and issues.
- A dedicated email address will be provided for direct support, reflecting the target audience (males aged 40+).
- Accounts will be maintained on each major social media platform for updates and community engagement.

## Error Reporting
- Both client and server will include error-logging systems to help identify and resolve issues quickly.

## Feedback
- Players can provide feedback via email or social media.
- Additional feedback mechanisms may be added as the userbase grows.

This approach ensures players have multiple, accessible ways to get help and share their experiences, supporting a positive and responsive community.
