# User Accounts & Profiles

## Guest Access
- Players can play as guests with no registration required.
- Guest players have access to all free modes (Single Player and Challenge Friends).

## Registration
- Registration is only required to transfer token balances and preferences between devices.
- Registered users may receive early access to new games in alpha mode.

## Profiles
- Registered users have a profile that is not personally identifiable.
- Profile features include:
  - Progression and achievements in single player mode
  - Record of victories against friends
  - Accumulation of "stars" or similar status symbols from tournament play
  - Avatars that reflect achievements and status, not personal identity

This approach keeps barriers low for new players while offering meaningful progression and status for those who register.
