# Analytics & Data

## AI Training & Game Data
- All games are played on the server, providing a rich dataset for training AI computer player "personalities" using genetic algorithms.
- The goal is to make AI opponents behave like real human players, without needing to fully understand all winning strategies for every game.

## Data Philosophy
- Analytics are used primarily to improve AI and gameplay experience, not for profit-driven optimization.
- Data collection is limited to what is necessary for improving the platform and player experience.

This approach balances the use of analytics for innovation (AI, gameplay) with respect for player privacy and the project's creative philosophy.
