# Error Handling & Recovery Strategies

Date: July 28, 2025

## Overview
This document describes the error handling and recovery strategies for Card Classics, ensuring robust, user-friendly, and maintainable game experiences.

## Goals
- Detect and handle errors gracefully
- Minimize user disruption and data loss
- Support recovery from disconnects and failures
- Log and monitor errors for continuous improvement

## Error Types
- **Client Errors:** Invalid input, unsupported actions, UI failures
- **Server Errors:** Internal exceptions, database failures, game logic errors
- **Network Errors:** Disconnects, timeouts, dropped packets

## Error Handling Strategies
- Validate all client actions and input server-side
- Use structured error responses (with codes and messages)
- Display clear, actionable error messages to users
- Retry transient operations (e.g., reconnect, resend)
- Fallback to safe states when possible (e.g., snapshot rendering)
- Log all errors with context for debugging

## Recovery Strategies
- **State Snapshots:** Periodically save game state; allow recovery after disconnect
- **Reconnect Logic:** Support automatic client reconnection to ongoing games
- **Graceful Degradation:** Disable non-essential features if errors occur
- **User Prompts:** Inform users of errors and guide them through recovery steps

## Monitoring & Logging
- Centralized error logging (server and client):
  - Both client and server code use an SDK or API to send error logs to a logging service (e.g., Sentry, CloudWatch, Stackdriver).
  - All errors are collected in one place for easy search, filtering, and analysis.
- Track error rates, types, and affected users
- Alert on critical failures or repeated issues:
  - Configure the logging service or cloud provider to send notifications (email, SMS, Slack, etc.) when critical errors or thresholds are detected.
  - Enables rapid response to major issues and outages.

## Best Practices
- Never expose sensitive error details to clients
- Use error boundaries in UI components
- Test error scenarios and recovery flows

## Future Considerations
- Automated error reporting and analytics
- Self-healing mechanisms for common failures
- User-facing status dashboards
