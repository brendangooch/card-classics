# MVP Metrics: Recording & Analysis

Date: July 28, 2025

## Key Metrics to Record & Analyze

### 1. Game Metrics
- Number of games started, completed, and abandoned
- Game duration (average, min, max)
- Game outcomes (win/loss/draw)
- Actions per game (swaps, bets, knocks, folds)
- AI vs. human win rates

### 2. Player Metrics
- Unique guest and registered users
- Session length and frequency
- Player progression (levels, achievements, tokens earned/spent)
- Tournament participation (entries, completions, wins)
- Registration conversion rate (guests to registered)

### 3. Engagement Metrics
- Daily/weekly/monthly active users (DAU/WAU/MAU)
- Retention rates (day 1, day 7, day 30)
- Feature usage (e.g., onboarding, help, game console interactions)
- Social interactions (invites sent, games played with friends)

### 4. Monetization Metrics
- Tokens purchased (bundles, subscriptions)
- Tournament entry fees and payouts
- Revenue per user (ARPU)
- Free vs. paid tournament participation

### 5. System Metrics
- Error rates (client/server)
- Latency and response times
- Backup and restore success rates
- Session drop/disconnect rates

## Next Steps
- Implement logging and analytics for these metrics in the backend and client.
- Use metrics to guide MVP improvements, onboarding, and future feature development.
- Regularly review and refine metrics based on user feedback and business goals.
