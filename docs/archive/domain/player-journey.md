# Player Journey

This document describes the typical journey of a player in Card Classics.

## Stages
1. **Single Player Mode**: Players start by playing free single-player games to learn and enjoy classic card games.
2. **Challenge Friends Mode**: Players can generate a link to challenge friends and play against each other online, also free to use.
3. **Tournament Play**: Players participate in point-scoring and status-building tournaments, which require tokens to enter. Tournaments may be single games or multi-table scheduled events with any mix of human and AI players.
4. **Token Purchase**: If a player runs out of tokens, they can purchase a token bundle to continue playing in tournaments.

## Additional Notes
- Players are drip-fed free tokens over time, allowing new players to try tournament play without financial commitment and keeping the game lobby active.
- The journey is designed to maximize enjoyment and engagement, with monetization introduced only for competitive/tournament play.
