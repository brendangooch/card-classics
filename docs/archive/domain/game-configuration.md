# Game Configuration Approach

Card Classics balances simplicity and flexibility in game setup by offering strong default configurations with the option for deeper customization.

## Approach
- Each game and mode of play comes with a fixed default configuration, designed for quick and easy setup ("like a McDonald's menu").
- Players can choose to play with these defaults or dig deeper to fully customize their game experience.
- Customizable options may include (depending on the game):
  - Number of players (human or AI)
  - Number of jokers or wild cards
  - Number of lives or rounds
  - Other game-specific rules
- Special single-player challenges and tournament lobbies will offer curated configurations and unique rule sets.

## Benefits
- Streamlined experience for most users
- Advanced options for enthusiasts
- Supports both quick play and deep customization

## Tradeoffs
- Slightly more complex to implement and communicate
- Requires clear UI to distinguish defaults from custom options

This approach ensures a consistent, user-friendly experience while supporting a wide range of player preferences.
