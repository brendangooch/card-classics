# Business Model

This document outlines the business model for Card Classics.

## Free-to-Play Modes
- **Single Player Mode** and **Challenge Friends Mode** are free for all players.

## Token System
- Tournament play requires tokens (one token per online game or tournament entry).
- Tokens can be purchased in bundles.
- Players are drip-fed free tokens over time (similar to the “lives” system in games like Candy Crush) to ensure a steady flow of players and allow new users to try tournaments without financial commitment.


## Revenue & Monetization Strategies
- Initial revenue is generated from token sales for tournament and complex multiplayer games.
- Single player games may include advertising slots (e.g., a short ad before every N plays) as an alternative monetization strategy.
- Additional monetization options may be explored as the userbase grows (e.g., premium features, cosmetics, ads, etc.).

## Consistent Player Experience
- The experience of playing a game of cards on the platform should be consistent and enjoyable, with as few barriers as possible, regardless of the game or mode of play.

## Flexibility
- Any multiplayer card game can support any number of human and AI players, maximizing engagement and replayability.
