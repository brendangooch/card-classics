Date: July 28, 2025

## Overview
This document outlines accessibility and localization strategies for Card Classics, ensuring the game is usable and enjoyable for all players, regardless of ability or language.

## Accessibility Goals
- Support players with diverse abilities
- Meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards where practical
- Provide customizable UI and input options

## Accessibility Strategies
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA roles for all UI components
- Ensure keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Provide adjustable font sizes, contrast, and color themes
- Support screen readers and alternative input devices
- Avoid relying solely on color to convey information
- Allow users to pause, slow down, or replay animations
- Test accessibility features regularly

## Localization Goals
- Support multiple languages and regions
- Enable easy translation of UI text and messages
- Handle date, time, and number formats appropriately

## Localization Strategies
- Store all user-facing text in resource files (e.g., JSON, i18n)
- Use a localization library (e.g., i18next, react-intl) for dynamic language switching
- Detect user language preference automatically or via settings
- Design UI layouts to accommodate text expansion and RTL languages
- Test with real translations and edge cases

## Best Practices
- Involve users with disabilities in testing
- Document accessibility and localization requirements for all new features
- Monitor feedback and usage to improve inclusivity

## Future Considerations
- Voice control and audio descriptions
- Automated translation and accessibility audits
- Community-driven translation support
