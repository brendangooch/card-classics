## Notes
- Sequence may be adjusted for accessibility, device type, or user preferences
- Each view should be responsive and provide clear navigation options
- Favor multiple small, simple screens with single pieces of information or button lists, rather than complex "god" screensâ€”especially on mobile devices. This improves clarity, usability, and user focus.

## Next Steps
- Design wireframes for each launch view
- Implement logic for device detection and orientation prompts
- Test sequence on multiple devices
