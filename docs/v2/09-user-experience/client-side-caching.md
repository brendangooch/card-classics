# Client-Side Caching

## Overview
Fundamental components and essential data are cached on each client to reduce server requests and improve performance.

## Caching Strategy
- Cache static assets (menu layouts, icons, common views).
- Cache user-specific data (profile, achievements, settings) with expiration rules.
- Check cache before fetching from server; fetch only if data is missing or stale.
- Provide option to refresh or clear cache.

## Benefits
- Faster navigation and smoother user experience.
- Reduced server load and latency.
- Supports offline and low-connectivity scenarios.

## Implementation Tips
- Use localStorage, IndexedDB, or in-memory cache.
- Invalidate cache based on time, version, or explicit update.
