# Scoring & Code Systems: Balancing Simplicity and Engagement

Date: July 29, 2025

## Overview
This document explores the design of scoring and code systems for Card Classics, aiming to balance simple, functional UX with engaging, rewarding gameplay.

## Codes as Rewards
- Codes can be awarded for milestones, achievements, or player journey progress.
- Codes may replace or supplement traditional tokens, serving as access keys, achievement markers, or unlockables.
- UX should minimize memorization: use short, memorable codes, allow easy sharing/copying, and provide visual cues/history.

## Multiple Scoring Systems
- **Participation Rewards:** Frequent, satisfying prizes for playing, similar to casual games (e.g., Candy Crush).
- **Competitive/Tournament Scoring:** Structured points, rankings, and trophies for competitive play.
- **Journey/Nudge Scoring:** Points or codes awarded for following onboarding, learning, or guided actions.

## Engagement vs. Simplicity
- Frequent, “worthless” rewards boost engagement and satisfaction, but should not clutter or confuse the interface.
- All scoring and code systems must be presented with clear, functional UI—no unnecessary complexity.
- Use modular design: allow players to opt into or focus on the scoring system that fits their play style.

## UX Considerations for Codes
- Avoid requiring players to memorize multiple codes; provide history, reminders, and easy access.
- Use visual cues, icons, and context to help players recall and use codes.
- Keep codes short and meaningful; consider word-based codes for memorability.
- Word-based codes can use themes such as animals, famous people, geography, foods, or other fun categories. This adds variety and makes codes easier to remember and share.
- Thematic codes can be rotated seasonally or for special events, further enhancing engagement and memorability.


## Sponsored Codes & Influencer Partnerships
- Unique codes can be assigned to sponsored YouTubers, streamers, or influencers.
- Players who use a sponsored code when purchasing codes/tokens can be tracked for commission payouts.
- This system enables direct partnerships and revenue sharing with content creators, helping grow the community and incentivize promotion.

## Design Philosophy
Merge simple, functional design with engaging reward systems.
Prioritize clarity, accessibility, and player autonomy in all scoring and code features.


## Future Premium Features
- **Opponent Match Replay & Analysis:**
  - For premium subscribers, offer the ability to replay and analyze opponent matches using stored game commands.
  - Since all players are anonymous, this feature is transparent and ethical, supporting skill development and competitive play.
  - Premium subscription fees help cover the cost of storing game commands long-term, making this feature sustainable and scalable.
