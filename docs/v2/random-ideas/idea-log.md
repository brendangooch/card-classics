## Idea Entries

## [2025-07-30] Random Idea: HTML Buttons as Interactive Playing Cards

If I have full control over the entire viewport in immersive mode, consider using HTML buttons as interactive playing cards in the in-play view. This would leverage native accessibility, keyboard/touch/mouse support, and allow each card to trigger game actions, support focus states, and integrate with undo/redo command queues. Cards can be styled with CSS for appearance and animation.

## [2025-07-30] Random Idea: Universal Card Game Description in YAML

A challenging but powerful aim: enable the description of any card game in YAML, which can then be interpreted and played on any card-classics client. This would be the ultimate architectural goal, unlocking creative possibilities and broad game support.

## [2025-07-30] Random Idea: Local/Remote Game Server Support & Game Bundles

Consider building the client to handle both local and remote game servers. Develop a game server for the client that can remotely fetch game bundles from the server, enabling offline single player mode and flexible deployment.

## [2025-07-30] Random Idea: Friendly 'Help' Button/Icon for User Reassurance

Consider using a 'help' button or icon (instead of 'menu' or 'info') in the UI to make the app feel less intimidating. The app communicates to the user: "Don't worry, we know it's complicated, but you're not going to break anything by pressing a few buttons." This approach encourages exploration and reduces anxiety for new players.

## [2025-07-30] Random Idea: Global Help Icon with Button Explanations

Incorporate a global help icon that, when activated, displays a small static set of paragraphs for each view explaining what each button does. These explanations can be stored or declared as an array, making it easy to maintain and update. This provides clear, accessible guidance without overwhelming the user.

## [2025-07-30] Random Idea: Versioned API Routes for Flexible Client Functionality

Versioning each API route is a great idea. This approach makes it simple to switch or update functionality in client code on reload, supports backward compatibility, and enables smooth transitions during feature updates or migrations.
