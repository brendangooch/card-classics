# Backup Strategies & ShortID Implementation

Date: July 28, 2025

## Backup Strategies

### 1. Automated Database Backups
- Schedule regular backups of game state, player data, and session history.
- Store backups securely (encrypted, offsite/cloud storage).
- Retain multiple backup versions for disaster recovery.

### 2. Manual Export/Import
- Allow admin to export/import game data for migration or recovery.
- Provide tools for selective backup (e.g., specific games, user accounts).


### 3. In-Game State Snapshots & Persistent Backups
- On each game state update, overwrite the previous backup to ensure the latest state is always available.
- Periodically save snapshots during active sessions for additional recovery options.
- Enable recovery from recent state in case of server crash or disconnect.

### 5. Completed Game Cleanup
- When a game reaches "complete" status, delete or archive it (optionally parse for metrics first).
- A scheduled task routinely removes all completed game instances to keep storage efficient.

### 4. Backup Verification & Testing
- Regularly test backup integrity and recovery procedures.
- Automate verification to ensure backups are usable.

## ShortID Implementation

### Merits
- Generates short, unique, human-friendly IDs for games, sessions, and users.
- Easier to share, type, and reference than long UUIDs or database IDs.
- Useful for URLs, invites, and quick lookup.
- Can be combined with backup strategies for easy restoration and migration.


### Considerations
- No fixed slot limitation; ShortIDs are assigned to active games and released when games complete.
- Ensure uniqueness and collision resistance (use libraries like `shortid`, `nanoid`, or custom logic).
- Store mapping between ShortID and internal database IDs.
- Validate ShortID format for security and usability.
- Rotate or expire ShortIDs if needed for privacy or security.
