# Client/Server Versioning & Compatibility

Date: July 28, 2025

## Overview
This document describes strategies for managing client/server versioning and ensuring compatibility in Card Classics, supporting smooth updates and extensibility.

## Goals
- Prevent breaking changes between client and server
- Enable rapid addition of new features and games
- Support backward and forward compatibility

## Versioning Strategies
- Use semantic versioning for both client and server (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Include a `version` field in all API and payload responses
- Document changes and migration steps for each version
- Use cache busting for client updates (e.g., update HTML, assets)

## Compatibility Management
- Design payloads and APIs to be extensible and tolerant of unknown fields
- Maintain interpreters for multiple payload versions on the client
- Deprecate old versions gracefully with user notifications
- Validate client/server version compatibility on connection

## Update Process
- Announce breaking changes and required updates to users
- Support phased rollouts and opt-in beta features
- Monitor compatibility issues and user feedback

## Best Practices
- Avoid unnecessary breaking changes
- Test new versions with real user scenarios
- Document versioning requirements for all new features

## Future Considerations
- Automated compatibility checks and migration tools
- Version negotiation protocols for advanced features
- Long-term support (LTS) for major releases
